Here, I will introduce you an advanced BGS of high accuracy. It consists of opencv MOG and caffe SSD. I tried to use tensorflow, but after performance testing, I was disappointed a lot. Tensorflow is easy to use, but speed is extremely slower than caffe. SSD works on 30 FPS with caffe while less than 2 FPS with tensorflow.
That's why I chose caffe SSD.
